# Introduction to Ivy

<Ingress>
Ivy is a full-stack C# web framework that lets you build interactive data applications without the complexity of separate frontend/backend APIs. Think React patterns, but entirely in C#.

## What Makes Ivy Different

Ivy eliminates the traditional frontend/backend split by bringing React-like patterns directly to C#. You build your entire project - UI, logic, and data access - in one cohesive C# codebase.

```csharp
[App(icon: Icons.Users)]
public class UserDashboard : ViewBase
{
    public override object? Build()
    {
        var users = UseService<IUserService>();
        var searchTerm = UseState("");
        
        return new Card()
            .Title("User Management")
            | Layout.Vertical(
                searchTerm.ToTextInput(placeholder: "Search users..."),
                new Table(users.SearchUsers(searchTerm.Value))
                    .Columns(
                        col => col.Name,
                        col => col.Email,
                        col => col.LastLogin
                    )
            );
    }
}
```

## Why Ivy Exists

We created Ivy to solve common frustrations with modern web development:

### Cost & Speed Optimization

Everyday tasks should be simple and idiomatic. Complex requirements should remain possible, but building basic CRUD projects shouldn't require weeks of setup.

### Eliminating Boilerplate

Traditional SPA solutions require separate frontend/backend codebases communicating through APIs. This creates massive amounts of boilerplate for simple data operations.

### Avoiding Technical Debt

Many low-code SaaS products are limited, expensive long-term, and create vendor lock-in. Ivy gives you the productivity benefits without the constraints.

### Open-Source & Cloud-Native

Deploy anywhere - AWS, Azure, GCP, or your own infrastructure. No vendor lock-in, no proprietary hosting requirements.

## Core Features

### Full-Stack C# Development

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[C# Views] --> B[Widget Tree]
    B --> C[SignalR Hub]
    C --> D[React Frontend]
    D --> E[User Events]
    E --> C
    C --> A
    
```

- Full-stack C# development with no separate API layer needed
- React-like declarative UI patterns using C# syntax
- Views render into strongly-typed Widgets
- Built-in scaffolding for common patterns (Tables, Forms, CRUD operations)

### Real-Time & Interactive

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Input] --> B[C# Handler]
    B --> C[State Change]
    C --> D[Auto Re-render]
    D --> E[UI Update]
    
    F[Hot Reload] --> G[State Preserved]
    
```

- WebSocket-based UI updates (similar to Streamlit)
- Hot reloading with state preservation during development
- Any .NET object can be rendered using ContentBuilder pipelines
- Automatic change detection and selective re-rendering

### Modern Frontend Integration

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Ivy Widgets] --> B[React + Shadcn]
    B --> C[TailwindCSS]
    
    D[External Components] --> E[NuGet Packages]
    E --> A
    
    F[Dark Mode] -->  G[Theming System]
    G --> A
    H[Custom Chromes] --> A
    
```

- Widgets rendered using React + Shadcn + TailwindCSS
- Import external React components as Ivy widgets via NuGet
- Built-in dark mode and theming support
- Customizable application "chromes" (also built in Ivy)

### Enterprise Ready

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Security] --- B[Data] --- C[Architecture]
```

- Authentication & authorization providers with RBAC
- Entity Framework Core integration
- Secrets management and configuration
- Dependency injection throughout
- Caching and performance optimizations
- Flexible routing system

### Development & Deployment

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Your Code] --> B[ivy init]
    B --> C[ivy run]
    C --> H[Docker-first deployment]
    
    F[Rich CLI] --> B
    G[Unit Tests] --> A
    
```

- One-command container deployment to any cloud provider
- Rich CLI tooling for project scaffolding and deployment
- Unit testing without browser automation complexity
- Docker-first deployment with environment management

## Getting Started

Ready to try Ivy? The fastest way to get started is:

```terminal
>dotnet tool install -g Ivy.Console
>ivy init --namespace MyCompany.InternalProject
>dotnet watch
```

You can install Ivy with a simple command, check its version to verify if it installed correctly and initialize your first project.

That's it! You'll have a running Ivy application with hot reloading enabled.
