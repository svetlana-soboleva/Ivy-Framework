                We want to render [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org) diagrams inside Markdown content across Ivy apps and documentation.

                ## Goals

                * Render Mermaid code blocks in Markdown (```mermaid) as interactive diagrams.
                * Support inside `Text.Markdown`, `Markdown` widgets, and docs-generated `Article` content.
                * Automatic dark/light theme alignment with Ivy styles.
                * Lazy-load Mermaid only when content contains Mermaid diagrams.
                * Provide graceful fallback to code block if rendering fails.

                * Arbitrary Mermaid plugin execution.
                * Server-side diagram rendering.
                * Export/PNG generation (can be future work).

                1. As a docs reader, I can see Mermaid diagrams rendered in documentation pages.
                2. As a developer, I can add a ```mermaid code block to a `Markdown` widget and see it rendered.
                3. As a reader, I get readable fallback content if rendering fails.

                  A[User] -->|Clicks| B(Load Page)

                ## Acceptance Criteria

                * mermaid code fences render as diagrams in:
                  - Widgets using `Markdown` (runtime content)
                  - Docs pages generated via `Ivy.Docs.Tools` (Markdown converted to `Article` and `Markdown` widgets)
                * Theme matches Ivy dark/light mode and text sizing.
                * No layout overflow; large diagrams scroll within their container.
                * Mermaid script is loaded on-demand and cached.
                * Rendering is resilient: shows original fenced code when errors occur.
                * Safe by default: no remote includes or script injection via Mermaid config.

                ## Technical Notes (proposed)

                * Frontend (`frontend/src/components/MarkdownRenderer.tsx`):
                  - Add Mermaid support via a remark/rehype integration (e.g., `remark-mermaidjs` + post-render init) or a custom renderer for code blocks with `language-mermaid`.
                  - Lazy-load `mermaid` package only when needed; initialize once per theme.
                  - Observe theme changes to re-render or update Mermaid theme variables.
                * Docs generator (`Ivy.Docs.Tools/MarkdownConverter.cs`):
                  - No server-side rendering needed. Ensure fenced ```mermaid blocks pass through into `new Markdown("â€¦")` so frontend can render.
                * Widgets: ensure `Article` and `Markdown` containers allow overflow handling (scroll) for large diagrams.

                ## Risks / Constraints

                * Mermaid parsing errors must not crash the page.
                * Potential CSS conflicts; isolate Mermaid styles.
                * Performance on pages with many diagrams; batch initialize and avoid repeated reflows.

                ## Open Questions

                * Should we expose a widget-level option to disable Mermaid for specific views?
                * Do we need print/export support in v1?
                * How do we snapshot-test rendered diagrams reliably in CI?
