Read D:\Repos\_Ivy\Ivy-Framework\.releases\weekly-notes-2025-10-27.md

This is a weekly summary of changes made to the Ivy Framework.
Ivy is an open source framework for building apps in pure .Net and C#.

We have two repos with the current code:

C:\git\ivy\Ivy
C:\git\ivy\Ivy-Framework

I want you review the notes to make sure that they are coherent and well written. Double check that the code examples are correct and use the latest APIs. Make sure that the notes are interesting for someone using the framework and the CLI and short and descriptive.
