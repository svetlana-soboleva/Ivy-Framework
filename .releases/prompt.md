Ivy is an open source framework for building apps in pure .Net and C#.

We have two repos where we have downloaded all the commits done during a perios

Repo 1: Ivy Framework - Open source framework for building apps in pure .Net and C#.
Repo 2: Ivy CLI - Command line tools for the Ivy Framework. (Not Open Source)

One of these files are {{File}} (COMMIT)

Our overall goals is to write an update article about all the changes that have been done in these two repos. We want
it to be interesting for someone using the framework and the CLI and short and descriptive.

For API changes/additions, we want to show code examples on how to use the new APIs.

Read C:\git\ivy\Ivy-Framework\.releases\weekly-notes-2025-10-17.md (NOTES)

Read the COMMIT and update NOTES with the new changes. We will trigger this agent for each commit so don't spend time reading the others.

Skip stuff that doesn't affect the user of the framework or the CLI. Some commits are just internal refactorings or
changes that don't affect the user. Merge commits can be skipped. It is fine to do no edits to (NOTES) if there's noting interesting in the commit.

Write it all as a markdown article and add it to the file under an appropriate section. Make sure that you each time leave the article nice and coherent.
